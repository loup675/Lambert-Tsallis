# Lambert-Tsallis
This project page is dedicated to store any code used to graph the Lambert and Lambert-Tsallis function in my university project, as well as anything else related to it.

There's the .pdf file for my conclusion work on the topic.
Exact LaTeX source code is also to be added, but it's quite messy due to the university's mandated format (which i only managed to compile as good as it is due to Overleaf's buggy behavior), so I may later also add the source code (and pdf file!) for a far less messier outcome.

Per request of my professor, I won't be uploading the source code that computes the function (both in .m and .py), but it's fairly easy and the cookbook is in the work itself, so you can always check it out!

Might also add an english translation when I have some free time.

Any questions, feel free to contact me!
